# Syrian Development Association â€“ Aid Management API

A productionâ€‘grade Django REST Framework (DRF) backend powering the Syrian Development Associationâ€™s digital aid platform.  
The API serves two main audiences:

- **Administrative Dashboard** â€“ For managers and staff to review, approve, and track beneficiary requests, manage aid categories, and monitor operational metrics.
- **User Portal** â€“ For beneficiaries to request financial assistance, medical support, or funding for small business projects, and track application status.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Fully implemented with **Classâ€‘Based Views (CBVs)** for clean, maintainable, DRFâ€‘idiomatic architecture.
- Explicit read/write serializer separation for predictable data handling.
- Secure authentication and roleâ€‘based access control.
- POSTâ€‘based filtering and search for complex queries without breaking client compatibility.
- Secrets management via environment variables (no hardâ€‘coded credentials).
